# Dice Challenge
The Dice Challenge Game is a web-based application designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive and randomized gaming experience between two players. Upon reloading the page, players are presented with a simple and visually appealing interface.

The game interface consists of two player sections, each displaying the player's name and current score. Two dice images are prominently featured in the center of the page, representing the dice for each player. The design ensures clear visibility of the game elements, creating an intuitive user experience.

Players initiate the game by clicking the "Roll Dice" button. This action triggers a JavaScript function that simulates the rolling of two dice, each displaying a random number between 1 and 6. The total sum of the numbers rolled on both dice contributes to the player's score.

The dynamic updating of the dice images, along with the instantaneous adjustment of each player's score, is achieved through JavaScript without the need for a page reload. This ensures a smooth and responsive gameplay experience.

The winner is determined based on the comparison of the total scores of both players after each roll. The player with the higher score is declared the winner, and their victory is visually highlighted on the interface.

The game's simplicity encourages users to engage in multiple rounds, providing an entertaining and luck-based challenge with each reload. The combination of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity creates an enjoyable Dice Challenge Game that can be easily accessed and replayed in any modern web browser.
